# PET APP

 This is a front end of the pet app where a user can have a pet and give a rating comment on any pet. 
 My initial idea was to have a comment on each pet card  so that all the comments ralated to each pet are on every card.
 I am looking foward to implementing this   featurein soon...

 ## BACKEND
 you can access the back end API by using this link [backend](https://github.com/KorosDennis/phase-3-sinatra-react-project).

This feature was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
##### step 1.
```
to run the application you run 'npm start' on the terminal
````
##### step 2.
```
open another terminal  under the back end and run 'bundle exec rake server'
 ```
#### step 3.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
